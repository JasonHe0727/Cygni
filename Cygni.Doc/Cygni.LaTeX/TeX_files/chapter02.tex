\chapter{Some small examples}
Ok, if you have some programming experience before, I think maybe you don't have to go through all of the contents. Some small examples may be more helpful. Let's begin.


\section{Factorial}
This is a very traditional example. 


\begin{lstlisting}
def fact(n){
	if n == 0 { 1 }
	else { n * fact(n - 1) }
}
fact(10)
=> 3628800
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Position}
Have a look at another example.
\begin{lstlisting}
class Position{
	def __INIT__(nx, ny){
		this.x = nx
		this.y = ny
	}
	
	def move(nx, ny){
		this.x = nx
		this.y = ny
	}
	
	def __TOSTRING__(){
		printf("({0}, {1})", this.x, this.y)
	}
	
}

p1 = Position(10,20)
print(p1)
p1.move(35,47)
print(p1)
\end{lstlisting}
