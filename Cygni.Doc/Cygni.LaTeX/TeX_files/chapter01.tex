\section{What is Cygni}
Cygni is a scripting language, implemented in C\#. 
I designed Cygni in my spare time, and I love it very much. I hope you will like it!
\section{What can Cygni do}
Cygni supports both procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming. It has simple syntax, you will learn it quickly if you have programming experience before. It interacts with C\# pretty well, therefore you can easily wrap C\# methods and classes, then import them into Cygni. Or you can do it the other way round.
\section{The inspiration of Cygni}
The design of Cygni is inspired by some scripting language, such as Python, Lua, etc. Thanks to these great languages!
